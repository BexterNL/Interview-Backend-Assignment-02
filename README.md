# Solve the magic square and determine the magic number

This puzzle comes from Lewis Carroll.
The magic part is when the values on a square are arranged,
so that adding them up in any direction results in a constant sum.
 
You have the following values:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
 
You need to arrange them in a 3 x 3 matrix so that:
The sums of numbers in each row = magic number
The sums of numbers in each column = magic number
The sums of numbers in each diagonal = magic number
